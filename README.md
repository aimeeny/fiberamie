# Fiber Amie

## A fiber companion app.

Major features:
- Needle and/or crochet hook virtual organization
- Yarn stash database
- Project tracker

There is currently a gap in the fiber app/website market where no mobile-friendly, accesible, English-language knitting/crochet companion app exists. This application is intended to fill that gap. 

## Features

### Knitting needle and crochet hook virtual storage.

### Yarn stash virtual storage that allows users to search and filter by any keyword - fiber type, yarn weight, color, brand, etc.

### Project tracker to keep track of current and completed projects.

### Mobile-friendly, accessible design (no harsh contrast, animations, or glaring colors).
